### Changelog entry format

Here are a few examples:

* Mark it up in [Markdown syntax][6].
* The entry line should start with `* ` (an asterisk and a space).
* If the change has a related GitHub issue (e.g. a bug fix for a reported issue), put a link to the issue as `[#1](https://github.com/fernandonogueira/Ox/issues/1): `.
* Describe the brief of the change. The sentence should end with a punctuation.
* At the end of the entry, add an implicit link to your GitHub user page as `([@username][])`.
* If this is your first contribution to Ox project, add a link definition for the implicit link to the bottom of the changelog as `[@username]: https://github.com/username`.
